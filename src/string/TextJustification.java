  /**
   * Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
   *
   * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
   *
   * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
   *
   * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
   *
   * Note:
   *
   * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
   * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
   * The input array words contains at least one word.
   * Example 1:
   *
   * Input:
   * words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
   * maxWidth = 16
   * Output:
   * [
   *    "This    is    an",
   *    "example  of text",
   *    "justification.  "
   * ]
   * Example 2:
   *
   * Input:
   * words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
   * maxWidth = 16
   * Output:
   * [
   *   "What   must   be",
   *   "acknowledgment  ",
   *   "shall be        "
   * ]
   * Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
   *              because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
   *              Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
   * Example 3:
   *
   * Input:
   * words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
   *          "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
   * maxWidth = 20
   * Output:
   * [
   *   "Science  is  what we",
   *   "understand      well",
   *   "enough to explain to",
   *   "a  computer.  Art is",
   *   "everything  else  we",
   *   "do                  "
   * ]

  	/* General Approach: 1.Calculate the maximum number of word each line could pack -> count
    2.Calculate the length of the space of each line = maxWidth - count
    3.Distribute the space as evenly as possible, if we could not distribute evenly, we add the reminder space from left to right
       i.At the last line - we should deal as special case
       ii.Not at the last line - be careful of the case when number of the space is not even
    Specific process:
    	1. How do we know what is the maximum number of word we could pack each line?
    	We compare maxWidth with total of( n-words length + (n-1)Space)
    	e.x ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]  maxWidth = 16
    	The maximum words we could insert are "-->This is an" 4+1+2+1+2=10,could we add one more word "example", obviously impossible

   		2.To find the number of space in each line, we could just have maxWidth minus the length of all words in this line
   		In the above example would be 16-10 = 6 --> we will have 6 space at this line

   		3. When we have the numbers of space, we need to insert the space b.w the word. How to do so?
   			a. If this line is the last line, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
  			b. If this line is not the last line, we have another two cases to consider:
  				i.space could be evenly contributed
  				ii. space could not be evenly contrinuted -> we insert the remain space from left to right
  			For example ["to","a"] maxWidth = 6
  			If this is the last line, we should have "to a  ";Otherwise, we have "to   a"

 		* It would be very easy to understand if we just run an simple following example with the code.
 		["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]  maxWidth = 16
